# Likelihood scan and contours

## User story
As an analyzer, I want to visualize a test statistic distribution around its minimum to present the results of my fit.

### Assumptions
- The distribution is supplied in a well-defined format.

### Acceptance criteria
- For one-dimensional cases, the test statistic distribution is visualized and can be intersected with horizontal lines to show confidence intervals.
- For two-dimensional cases, contours are drawn where the distribution intersects specific values, corresponding e.g. to the 68% and 95% confidence levels.
- Multiple distributions can be shown on the same figure.
- The best-fit point can be visualized for each distribution in the two-dimensional case.
- Reference points (e.g. expected minima) can be visualized in distributions.

## Example implementation

### As a function of a continuous parameter

The distribution of -2 ln Λ, based on profile likelihood ratio Λ, is shown as a function of a cross-section σ.
Multiple lines visualize the distribution when considering all or only some sources of uncertainty.
The horizontal lines intersecting with the distributions visualize the 1σ and 2σ confidence intervals.

### As a function of two continuous parameters

The figure shows expected 68% and 95% confidence level contours as a function of two parameters.
The best-fit points are highlighted for each distribution, and the expected best-fit point is shown as a star.
